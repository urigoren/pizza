Mr. Braun  went to a 90s glam rock concert. He cosumed 20 mg of thc each before the concert, and he can feel it build up.
The lights are off, the warm up band is playing. Mr. Braun closes his eyes and he sees shapes, figures dancing according to the music. Cartoon like scenes, no plot. 
He sees the hallucinations intermixing with open eye vision as well, he notices that the singer's hair is sometimes perceived as a headband and sometimes not- she wasn't wearing a headband.
Then, he closes his eyes and sees pizza like triangles, with blurry borders in the shape of the beat.
Sinus, cosinus and exponential decay - Mr. Braun started coding and implementing what he sees in his minds eye.
The show was over, Mr. Braun came back home - and recreated his hallucinations in javascript.
